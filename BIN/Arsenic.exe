Description           
       
  Arsenic is a metalloid and has various allotropes, but only
the gray form has the metallic appearance. It occurs in many
minerals, but also as a pure elemental crystal. The most common
arsenic allotropes are gray, yellow and black arsenic, with gray
being the most common. Arsenic is a common n-type dopant in semi-
conductor electronic devices. Arsenic and its compounds, especially
the trioxide are used in the production of pesticides, treated 
wood products, herbicides and insecticides.
