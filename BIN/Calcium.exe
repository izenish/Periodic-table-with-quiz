Description           
	Calcium is an alkaline earth metal. Calcium is a reactive metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air. it is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate. Calcium is a very ductile silvery metal whose properties are very similar to the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium.
