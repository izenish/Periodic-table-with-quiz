Description
	
     Silicon is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust. 
It is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass but very 
rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. It is a hard and 
brittle crystalline so,id with a blue-grey metallic lustre. It is a 
tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor. Silicon is too reactive to be 
found in nature but it is found in all rocks as well as in sand, clays,
and soils.
