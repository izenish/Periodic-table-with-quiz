Description           
	
      Vanadium is the 20th most abundant element in the Earth's crust.
It occurs naturally in about 65 minerals and in fossil fuel deposists. 
It is a hard and silvery grey in appearance. It is malleable and ductile
transition metal. Vanadium is rarely found in nature but the formation of 
an oxide layer stabilizes the free metal against further oxidation. The
cosmic abundance of vanadium in the universe is 0.0001%, making the element
nearly as common as copper or zinc.
