Description           
	Bromine is the third lightest halogen and is a fuming red-brown
liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similar 
colour gas. It is less abundant in the crust. It is very reactive and 
doesnot occur free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline 
mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. It is rather rare in 
the Earth's crust. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-
hundred that of chlorine.
