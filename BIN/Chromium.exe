Description           
	Chromium is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle 
transition metal. It is a silvery metallic. It boasts a high 
usage rate as a metal that is able to be highly polished while
resisting tarnishing. It is the main component of stainless 
steel, a popular steel alloy due to its uncommonly high specular
reflection. Simple polished chromium rreflects almost 70% of the
visible spectrum, with almost 90% of infrarerd light waves being
 reflected.
