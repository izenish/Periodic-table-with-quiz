q1.setValues( The rows of the periodic table are called;
            classes,
            periods,
            groups,
            families,
            2,
            10);

q2.setValues(Who was the scientist credited with devising the first periodic table similar to the one we use today,
             John Dalton,
             Gregor Mendel,
             Dmitri Mendeleev,
             Ernest Rutherford,
             3,
             10);
q3.setValues(The primary difference between the modern periodic table and Mendeleev's periodic table is,
The two tables are the same except we know about more elements now.,
Mendeleev's table did not arrange the elements according to recurring trends in their properties.,
The elements in the modern table are arranged in order of increasing atomic weight.,
The elements in the modern table are arranged in order of increasing atomic number.,

q4.setv]Values(As you move from left to right across the periodic table,
atomic radius decreases,
atomic radius increases,
ionization energy decreases,
electronegativity decreases,

q5.setValues(As you move from top to bottom down the periodic table,
a change in atomic radius cannot be predicted,
atomic radius decreases,
electronegativity decreases,
ionization energy increases,

q6.setValues(Which of the following are all properties of nonmetals,
usually donate electrons easily, typically brittle in the solid form, poor conductors of heat,
usually gain electrons easily, poor conductors of heat, poor conductors of electricity,
usually gain electrons easily, good conductors of heat and electricity,
usually donate electrons easily, metallic luster, good conductors of heat,

q8.setValues(Where would you find the smallest atoms of elements in the periodic table,
top and lefthand side,
top and righthand side,
bottom and lefthand side,
bottom and righthand side,
2,

q9.setValues(Electron affinity reflects the ability of an atom to accept an electron. Which is true of the alkaline earths,
No generalization can be made about electron affinity for this element group.,
The alkakine earths have low electron affinity values.,
The alkaline earths have high electron affinity values.,
None of the above,

q10.setValues(With respect to electron affinity, which statement applies to the halogens,
The halogens have low electron affinity values.,
The halogens have high electron affinity values.,
No generalization can be made about electron affinity for this element group.,
None o the above,
