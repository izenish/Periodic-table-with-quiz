Description           
	Neon is a chemical element which is a colourless and odorless.
 It is a noble gas. It occurs as inert monoatomic gas under standard 
conditions. It is chemically inactive. So far, it has been impossible 
to make neon react with any other element or compound. Although neon 
is the fourth most abundant element in the universe but only 0.0018% 
of the earth's atomsphere is neon. Neon is non flammable and has little
combustible. It is the least reactive elements on the entire peroidic 
table.
