Description           
	Germanium is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the 
carbon group. A pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance 
similar to elemental silicon. It naturally reacts and forms complexes 
with oxygen in nature. Under standard conditions, germanium is a brittle,
silvery-white, semi-metallic element and form constitutes of an allotrope 
known as a-germanium, which has a metallic luster and a diamond cubic
crystal structure. Germanium is created by stellar nucleosynthesis, mostly 
by the s-process in asymptotic giant branch stars.
