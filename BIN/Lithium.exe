Description  
	Lithium is the chemical element which is a soft, silvery-white 
alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and 
the lightest solid element. It is highly reactive and flammable, and 
is stored in mineral oil. It exhibits metallic luster, but moist air 
corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray, theb black tarnish. It never
occurs freely in nature, but only in compounds  such as pegmatitic mine-
rals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility 
as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines.
