Description 
	Boron is a chemical element which is low-adundance element in
 the solar system and the Earth's crust. It is concentrated on Earth 
by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occuring compounds,
 the borate minerals. It is usually black-brown in colour. It is a metta-
loid that is found in small amounts in meteroids but chemically uncombined 
boron is not otherwise found naturally on the Earth. A very pure boron is
produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or
other elements. Several allotropes of boron exits: amorphous boron is a 
brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black; extremely hard and poor
electrical conductor at the room temperature.
