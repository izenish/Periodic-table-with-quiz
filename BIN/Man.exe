Description           
    
    Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses,
particularly in stainless steel. It is a silvery metallic metal that 
resembles iron. It is not found in minerals in combination with iron. 
It is hard and very brittle, difficult to fuse, but easy to oxidize. 
Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic. It tarnishes 
slowly in air and oxidizes like iron in water containing dissolved 
oxygen.
