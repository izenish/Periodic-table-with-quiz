Description           
	  
    Cupper is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very
high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface
of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. It is used as a conductor
of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent
of various metal alloys. It is one of the few metals that can occur in
nature in a directly usable metallic form. Copper compounds are used 
as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides and wood preservatives.
