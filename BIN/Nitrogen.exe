Description           
	Nitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the peroidic table,often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the MilkyWay and the Solar System. Nitrogen is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas. It is relatively considered as inert gas. Nitrogen is non metal diatomic gas with an electronegativity of 3.0. It is almost inert gas in nature.
