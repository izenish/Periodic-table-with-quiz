Description           
	
          Zinc is the first element in group 12 of the peroidic table. Zinc
is chemically similar to magnesium as both elements exhibit only one normal
oxidation state (+2). It is the 24th most abundant element in the Earth's 
crust and has five stable isotopes. It is a bluish-white, lustrous and dia-
magnetic metal. It is the fair conductor of electricity. The most common zinc
ore is sphalerite, a zinc sulphide mineral. Zinc is refined by froth flotation
of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity.
