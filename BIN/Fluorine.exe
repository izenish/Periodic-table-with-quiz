Description           
	Fluorine is a lightest chemical element and exists as a 
highly toxic pale yellow in color. At standard conditions, it
exists in diatomic gas. It is extremely reactive , as it reacts
with almost all other elements, except for helium and neon. It
ranks 24th in universal abundance and 13th in terrestrial abundance.
