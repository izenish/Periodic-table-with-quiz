Description    
	Oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, 
after hydrogen and helium. It is a colorless, tasteless, odourless 
gaseous element that constitutes 21 percent of the atmosphere and 
is found in water, in most rocks and minerals, and in numerous
organic compounds. It is capable of combining with all elements
except the inert gases and is involved especially in combustion 
processes. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the peroidic 
table. It is a highly reactive non-metal, and an oxidizing agent 
that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other
compounds.
