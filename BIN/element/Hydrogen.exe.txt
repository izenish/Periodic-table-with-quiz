Description           
	Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe.Nearly nine out of every ten atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is also common on the Earth. It is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon. About 15 percent of all the atoms found on the Earth are hydrogen atoms.
	It is the simplest of all elements. Its atoms consists of one proton and one electron.It is a colourless, odourless,tasteless and flammable gaseous substance. It is a diatomic molecule,H2. The one of the important chemical property is that it burns with oxygen to form water. Hydrogen consists of three isotopes i.e Protium (H), Deuterium (D) and Tritium (T).
