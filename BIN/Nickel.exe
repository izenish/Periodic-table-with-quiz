Description           
	
   Nickel is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge.
Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. A pure 
native nickel is found in Earth's crust only iin tiny amounts, usually 
in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel-iron meteorites 
that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere. Nickel is
one of the element that is ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature.
