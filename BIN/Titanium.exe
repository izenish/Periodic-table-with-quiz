Description           
	
        Titanium is the fourth most common metal elements in the Earth's
crust (behind aluminium, iron, and magnesium). It is a lustrous transit-
ion metal with a silver color and has low density and high strength. It is
resistant to corrosion in sea water, aquaregia and chlorine. Titanium is
non-magnetic and biocompatible (non-toxic, non-allergenic), which has led
to its increasing use in the medical field. The production of titanium metal
is extremely sensitive to contamination and particularly by oxygen.
