Description           
	Argon is the third most gas element in the Earth's atmosphere. 
It is a colorless gas exhibiting a lilac/violet glow when placed in an 
electric field. Nearly all of the argon in the Earth's atmosphere is 
radiogenic argon-40, derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the 
Earth's crust. In the universe, argon-36 is by far the most common 
argon isotope, as it is the most easily produced by stellar nucleo-
synthesis supernovas.
