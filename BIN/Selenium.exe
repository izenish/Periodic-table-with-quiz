Description           
	
      Selenium is a non-metal and rarely consider as a metalloid. It rarely
occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earth's crust.
It is black, red and gray allotropes. It is found in metal sulphide ores,
where it partially replaces the sulphur. It is a semiconductor and is used
in photocells. Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts 
are necessary for cellular function in many organisms. It is a component of 
the antioxidant enzymes.
