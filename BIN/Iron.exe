Description           
	
          Iron is the first metal in the transition series. It is 
the most common element on Earth in terms of mass, forming Earth's
outer and inner core. It is the fourth most commmon element in the
Earth's crust. Its abundant in rocky planets like Earth is due to 
its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars. It is lustrous
metallic with a grayish tinge.
