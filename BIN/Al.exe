Description
	Aluminium is the third abundant element. It is a silvery-white,
soft, non-magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group. It is so ch-
emically reactive that the native specimens are rare and limited to 
extreme reducing environment. It is primordial in occurrence. The most
common form of aluminium found in nature is aluminium sulphates.
