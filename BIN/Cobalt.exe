Description           
	Cobalt is a free element produced by reductive smelting. It is
a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal. It is found in the Earth's crust
only in chemically combined form. Cobalt is a ferromagnetic metal with
a specific gravity of 8.9. It has a relative permeability two-thirds 
that of iron. It is a weakly reducing metal that is protected from 
oxidation by a passivating oxide film.
