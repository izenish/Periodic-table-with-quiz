Description           
	Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium and xygen. It is unique diversity of organic compounds and its unususl ability toform polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on the Earth which enables this element to serve as a common element of all knownlife. It is the secondmost abundant element in the human bodyby mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen. Thebest known allotropes of Carbon are graphite, diamond and amorphous carbon.Graphite is opaque and black white diamond and is soft enough to form a strak on paper. It is good electrical conductor while diamond is a low electrical conductor.
