Description           
	
            Potassium is a alkali metals having a single valence electron in the
 outer electron shell. It occurs only in ionic salts. Potassium is a soft silvery-
white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water.
It is found dissolved in sea water. It is the second least dense metal after lithium.
It is a soft solid with a low melting point, and can be easily cut with a knife. 
It is an extremely active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air.
