Description           
	Chlorine is the second most abundant and lightest element 
of the halogens. It appears between fluorine and bromine in the 
peroidic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between
them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is 
an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent among 
the elements. It has the highest electron affinity and the third 
highest electronegativity. The most commomn compopund of chlorine 
is sodium salt (NaCl). In the earth's crust, chlorine are in the 
form of ionic chloride compounds, which includes table salt.
