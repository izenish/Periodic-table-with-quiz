Description           
	Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe. It is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and (usually) two neutrons. It is a colorless, odourless, tastaless, non-toxic, inert and monoatomic gas. It is the first in noble gas group in the peroidic table. In the Earth's atmosphere, the concentration of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million. Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite, pitchblende, carnotite and monazite, because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stoppsed by the rock. It is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, for inflating balloons, and as a protective gas for many purposes.
