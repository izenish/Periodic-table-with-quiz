Description           
	Gallium is a soft, silvery blue metal at standard temperature
and pressure, a brittle solid at low temperature and a liquid at a
high temperature. It is not found in nature, but it is easily obtained
by smelting. A very pure gallium has a silvery color and its solid 
metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Galiium are highly anisotropic
i.e have different values among the three major crystallographical axes.
They are strongly temperature dependent.
